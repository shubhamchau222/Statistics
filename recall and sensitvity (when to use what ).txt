    -  Precision measures that out of all the positive predicted examples, how many detections were correct?
    -  Recall measures that out of all actual positive examples, how many were we able to identify?

            Letâ€™s dive right into what we have been waiting for â€” the different use-cases 
                    where we prioritize one metric over the other.

            1) Medical test (eg. cancer detection):  Recall is more important

                        ðŸ”– It is okay to classify a healthy person as having cancer (false positive) 
                        and following up with more medical tests, 
                        but it is definitely not okay to miss identifying a cancer patient or 
                        classifying a cancer patient as healthy (false negative) since the personâ€™s
                        life is at stake.

            2) Recommendation Systems: Precision is more important
                        ðŸ”– Missing out to recommend a particular famous movie is okay (low recall), 
                        but the overall recommendations should be good. If the customer is shown a lot
                        of irrelevant results (false positives), it will be a very bad experience for the user.

            3)  Predicting a good day based on weather conditions to launch satellite: Precision is more important
                        ðŸ”– Missing out to predict a good weather day is okay (low recall),
                        but predicting the wrong weather day (false positive) to launch the 
                        satellite can be disastrous.

            4)  Criminal death punishment: Precision is more important
                        ðŸ”– Missing out to punish a criminal is okay (low recall), 
                        but incriminating an innocent person (false positive) is undesirable.

            5)  Email spam detection: Precision is more important
                        ðŸ”– Missing out to detect/classify a spam email is okay (low recall),
                        but no legit or important email must go into the spam folder (false positive).

            6) Identifying good customers for a bank loan: Precision is more 
                        ðŸ”– Missing out to identify/classify a good customer eligible for the loan is okay (low recall), 
                        but approving a loan to a bad customer (false positive) who may never repay it is undesirable.

            7) Flagging fraudulent transactions: Recall is more important
                        ðŸ”– It is okay to classify a legit transaction as fraudulent â€” 
                        it can always be reverified by passing through additional checks.
                        But it is definitely not okay to classify a fraudulent transaction
                        as legit (false negative).
