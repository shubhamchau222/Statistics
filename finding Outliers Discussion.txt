Here , we Discussed Some Mehtods of finding an outilers and their treatement.

Outliers Defination :- 
********************

basically outliers is nothing but observation that lies an abnormal 
distance from other values in a random sample from a population. 

**********************************************************************
How To find Outliers?
-- 
There are several methods oof finding the outliers .
 	 1.Using the imperical Formulae(when data is normally distrubuted)
 	 2. IQR (inter Quantile range method)
  	 3.Box_plot
  	 4.Scatter diagram 
	 5. By clustering methods
   6. 5 number summery ( min , q1 , meadian ,q3 ,max) or  (IQR  statistic)
 
Discussion about the Evaluaing the Outliers .

 method 1> Using Imperical formulae :- 
************************************
As we know that , whenever the data is normaly distrubuted ,then it follows the Imoperical formulae.
Imperical formulae states that :- 
within ( mean +- 1 std.deviation)---> 68.5% data exist
whitin (mean +- 2nd std deviatiation)---->95.44% data exist 
whitin (mean +- 3rd std deviatiation)---->99.72% data exist 
hence based on that we can find out the upper boundary as well as lower boundary.
therefore , 
 upper_boundary = mean + (3 * std_deviation)
 lower_boundary = mean - (3* std_deviation)

The data lies outside of the both of the boundaries (upper_boundary & Lower_boundary) 
is called as the Outliers..
Note : -   this method is only applicable to the Normally distrubuted data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

method 2 > IQR method : - 
**********************
 This method is applicable to the skewed data either(positive/negative skewed).
skewed data is not follows the imperical formulae , hence we don't use the above method.
 Process : - 
    	1. find out the mean.
	2. find out IQR = (quantile(0.75) - quantile(0.25))
	3. upper_boundary = Q3 + (1.5) IQR ------> (for Positively skewed ) 
	4.lower_boundary = Q1 - (1.5)IQR  -------->(for negarively skewed)
sometimes the extrem Upper and Lower boundary is used. in that case we only replace 1.5 by 3.
Extreme_UpperBoundary = mean  + (3)IQR
Extreme_LowerBoundary = mean - (3)IQR 

The point outside the boundaries are considered as an Outliers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

method 3 >  BOX_PLOT method :- 
******************************
 Boxplots are a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary 
(“minimum”, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and “maximum”).
This type of plot is used to easily detect outliers. 
It can also tell us if your data is symmetrical, how tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data
 is skewed.

Thw bubbles present above and below the  maximum ( mean + 1.5IQR ) value and minimum values (mean - 1.5IQR)
respectively , known as an Outliers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
method 4 ) -- Using Clustering (DBSCAN) 
*************************************

In DBSCAN clustering the data points which are neither the core point or boundaries are
considered as an Outliers : 
how to interprete outliers ? 
 generally, the Ouliers having cluster value (-1) ..
by extracting the len(-1:cluster) we get to know that number of outliers present in 
dataset.

Hand On :- 
>from sklearn.clustering import DBSCAN
>db = DBSCAN(eps = 0.4 ,Minpts = 11 )
>y_pred = db.fit_predict(x)
# here , we get y_pred values in terms of clusters 
#lets find_out the total number of cluster 

>no_clusters = len(set(y_pred)) - (1 if -1 in y_pred else 0 )
#here , we get the number of clusters
#lets finding out the number of  outliers present in dataset.

>numOutliers = list(y_pred).count(-1)

#### findout the location of the outliers
>x[y_pred==-1] 
#--> it will give us the total records having an Outliers 

*****************************************************************************************************************
6 ) 5 number summery:- 
       It have 5 main parameters [min , 25 percentile , median , 75 percentile , max]
       process ====> 
        step1 : - arrange the data in ascending or descending order 
        min -> minimum value --> code # min(arr) 
        max -> maximum value --> code # max(arr)
        25 percentile --> a =  25/100 * ( len(arr) +1 ) --> select the a'th index value ;# arr[a]
        75 percentile --> b =  75/100 * ( len(arr) +1 ) --> select the b'th index value ; # arr[b]
        IOR(Inter Quantile Range) = Q3 - Q1 = 75 percentile  - 25 percentile 
        Median ++> central value 
        
        # here we try to create lower and upper Boundary 
        # the Data lies outside this Boundaries are Considered as Outliers .
        
        Lower_boundary  = Q1 - 1.5 ( IQR ) 
        Upper_boundary  = Q3 + 1.5 ( IQR ) 
        
        By using these 5 parameters we can plot the (BOX PLOT)....
        
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outliers_treatments:- 
1. sometime ,  we can remove the outliers.if we have the large datasets and also depends on the problem statement 
2. Transformation : -  sometimes , removing the ouliers considered as the lost of information .
                       In health care project or the stock market analysis we can't drop the ouliers.
			at that time we can kept is as it is .
			or can be transformed in to the max_value . 
			replace ouliers----> max_values.
